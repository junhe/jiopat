        <p>JIOPAT is a toolkit including many tools/libs/systems for I/O Pattern study. It includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>LibPatternDetector</strong>: This is a library for pattern detection. The pattern detection algorithm is from I/O Acceleration with Pattern Detection (HPDC'2013). (I still need to extract the functions from my codes to build this library.)</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/junhe/pap-fs">PAP-FS</a></strong>: it is Pattern-Aware Prefetching File System based on FUSE. The prefetching uses I/O pattern detection algorithm proposed in I/O Acceleration with Pattern Detection (HPDC'2013). Some other prefetching techniques are also implemented. (The system is not very user-friendly at this time since it is still a prototype for the paper. It will be better soon, though.) </li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/junhe/plfs">Pattern-PLFS</a></strong>: A version of PLFS using pattern detection algorithm to reduce the amount of indices. </li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/junhe/fuse-io-tracer">FUSE-IO-Tracer</a></strong>:  FUSE-Tracer records fine-granularity I/O requests with information such as hostname, offset, length, PID, operation start time, operation end time.  It is very easy to use and it does
not require recompilation of the application to be traced or any libraries.  To use FUSE-Tracer, all you need to do is mount FUSE-Tracer on a directory and file operations performed on the mount will be recorded to a file.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/junhe/fuse-io-tracer/tree/master/trace-replayer">Trace-Replayer</a></strong>: Trace-Replayer is a tool that replays the traces collected by FUSE-Trace; it also provides some extra functionalities such as adding fixed computational delays be-tween I/O operations. </li>
<li>
<strong>MapReplayer</strong>: It can replay traces previously collected by PLFS (generated by plfs_map) and show the performance. (I have the code but need to organize it and put it here.)</li>
</ul><p>Please be aware that all projects above are not production-ready yet. You take your own risk using them.</p>
